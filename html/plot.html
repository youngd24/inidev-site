    <h1>INITECH, what happened next...</h1>
    <p class="p75">
       In February of 1999 the documentary, I mean, movie, about the company INITECH was released
      in theaters across the known universe. At the time I had been in technology for around 5 years,
      most of that time spent in what we affectionately refer to as "cubicle farms" so, needless to say,
      much of it resonated with me and many, many others. This site and setup is really my homage to that
      era of tech, it was some of the best, and worst, periods possible.
    </p>
    <p class="p75">
       So now we set the stage, the year is 1999, inline with the release of the documentary
      film and treats life like that, as if it were a real documentary. Given that timeline we can guess a
      few things, first, when did the fire take place? Best guess is late 1997 or early 1998, we're going
      to go with the latter and place our new hero about a year later, let's call it March 1999. After the
      fire the first thing anyone would have started on is some level of business continuity and resumption
      activities, revenue needs to be preserved which involves some level of Disaster Recovery operation:
      <b>get systems back online ASAP</b>.
    </p>
    <p class="p75">
      For some reason, many of the INITECH staff, notably the system support staff, had either disappeared 
      or opted to depart the organization leaving the system support staff at their parent company, INIVEST,
      in a tough spot. They pulled together what people they could and hired on additional contract help,
      mostly through personal networks. This rag tag group of geeks then scoured all of Texas trying to find
      whatever gear they could to rebuild things back with, nearly everything burnt up in the fire. through
      a combination of locating used gear to leveraging relationships with manufacturers, they scrounged up
      enough to rebuild most of the office networks as well as the WAN that connects them.
    </p>
    <p class="p75">
      Which brings us to that network, it's what is in front of, or available to you, right now. At the same
      time guess what INITECH has decided they need to do? Come on, it's 99! Work with me here ... Online 
      video games, over the Internet. We're gonna pivot to being a <b>GAME COMPANY!</b>
